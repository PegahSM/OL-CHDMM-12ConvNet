# OL-CHDMM-12ConvNet
A New Feature Extraction Method for Human Action Recognition using Wavelet Analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks
This repository includes the implementation of my master's thesis in AI and Robotics done at 2020 

In this thesis we propose a new method “OL-CHDMM+12ConvNet” based on deep convolutional neural 
networks as classifier and it includes a novel feature extraction which is an extension of 
AH_DMM and WHDMM and can extract more temporal feature of depth sequence than 
traditional DMM. We are using wavelet as descriptor in our method. We show that OL
CHDMM+12ConvNet has acceptable results predicting the unknown label by extracting just 
one level hand-crafted feature and it is faster than other methods.
